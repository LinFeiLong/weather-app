# Welcome to Weather App

https://github.com/LinFeiLong/weather-app<br>
<br>

This app was made during a recruitment test for [HappyPal](https://www.happypal.fr/).<br>
https://www.notion.so/Give-me-weather-5050ba0e2d0e43768d243c916e80c0f5

The design is inspired from the Weather app from Kostya Sobol<br>
https://dribbble.com/shots/13372672-Weather-app<br>
and also The Weather Channel app from iOS.
<br><br>
Things I wish I had more time to do :
- Use of shared elements for Cards
- Dynamic background based on the weather
- Slide DetailScreen to view another city
- By default the first item shows the current location's weather

I spent 35 hours to make this app.

The app is published at Expo.io
