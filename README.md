# Welcome to Weather App

https://github.com/LinFeiLong/weather-app

This app was made for a recruitment test for HappyPal.

The deisgn is inspired from the Weather app from Kostya Sobol
https://dribbble.com/shots/13372672-Weather-app
and also The Weather Channel app from iOS.

Things I wish I had more time to do

- Use of shared elements for Cards
- Dynamic background based on the weather
- Slide DetailScreen to view another city
- By default the first item shows the current location's weather

I spent 34 hours to make this app.

The app is published at Expo.io
